Proxy Design Pattern :

Properties :

- Structural Design Pattern
- Used when you want to control access i.e In Databases, you would want to control the **delete** query available only for certain users like admin. 

Implementation :

- In general we have class which is executing interface executer method, which is executing all commands. 
- To control this, we add a Proxy class which implements the same interface and write conditions for admin user before proceeding to actual executer.
