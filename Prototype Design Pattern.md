## Prototype Design Pattern :

Prototype Pattern says that cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.

This pattern should be followed, if the cost of creating a new object is expensive and resource intensive.

Properties :

- Creational Design Pattern
- Used when we want to avaoid multiple Object creation of same instance, instead we copy the object to new object and then we can modify as per the need.
