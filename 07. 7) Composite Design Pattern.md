Composite Design Pattern :

Properties :

- Structural Design Pattern
- Composite lets client treat individual objects (Leaf) and compositions of objects (Composite) uniformly. 
- Four participants : Composite, Leaf, Composite, Client
- If object is Leaf node, request is handled directly, If object is Composite, it forward request to child, so some operation and combine operations. 


Implementation :

- Component : Account class, which contains common method
- Leaf : Deposite Account and Saving Account
- Composite : Composite Account
- Client : Client Class
- We will get balance of all account for a Person
