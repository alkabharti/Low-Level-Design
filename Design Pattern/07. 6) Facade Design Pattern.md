Facade Design Pattern :

Properties :

- Structural Design Pattern
- Used when there are multiple interfaces of similar kind of jobs, then we add a Facade interface, which provide better interface to these interfaces and clients. It basically help in routing to related interface. 
- For example : Drivers, Databases


Implementation :

- We will implement a Facade helper class, which will route to method related to specific class based on input.
