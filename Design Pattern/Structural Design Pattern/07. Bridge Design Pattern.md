Bridge Design Pattern :

Properties :

- Structural Design Pattern
- Used when we have hierarchies in both interfaces as well as implementations and we want to hide the implementation from client.
- It decouple abstraction from its implementation.
- Generally we have remote which works differently for Sony and Philips TV but we can have different Remote as well, i.e oldRemote and newRemote which have different methods for each TV. 
- For example : TV and Remote implmentation

Implementation :

- Class hierarchy : TV, SonyTV, Philips TV
- Interface hierarchy : Remote, OldRemote, NewRemote
- Client : Client Class
