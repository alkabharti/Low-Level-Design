##  Design Patterns :

A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.

In core java, there are mainly three types of design patterns, which are further divided into their sub-parts:

### 1.Creational Design Pattern
Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).


- Factory Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Prototype Pattern
- Builder Pattern.

### 2. Structural Design Pattern
Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.
The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.


- Adapter Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Proxy Pattern

### 3. Behavioral Design Pattern
Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.
In these design patterns, the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.


- Chain Of Responsibility Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Interpreter Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Memento Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Template Pattern
